            <h1>Why design + Coding Is Powerful</h1>

            <p>
                Design makes things look good. Coding makes things work.
                When you combine both, you create digital experiences
                that are not only functional but meaningful.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many developers can build websites.
                Many designers can create beautiful layouts.
                But the real power comes when one person understands both.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I grow in web development, I'm learning that design
                is not just about colors and fonts - it's about how users feel.
                And code is not just about syntax - it's about bringing ideas to life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Combining design and coding allows me to think creatively
                while building technically. It gives me full control over
                how a digital product looks and behaves.
            </p>

            <p>
                This is why I'm committed to mastering both.
                Because the future belongs to creators who can design and build.
